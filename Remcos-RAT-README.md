# Fileless Remcos Remote Access Trojan (May 2025)
<ul>
  <li>A malicious campaign was spotted in May 2025 that uses a stealthy strain of the Remcos RAT (Remote Access Trojan).</li>
  <li>It’s fileless. That means the attacker tries to avoid writing malicious files to disk; instead they use Windows built-in tools to load and run the malware in memory.</li>
  <li>Attackers delivered it via a combination of: a ZIP file (attached to a phishing email) → a Windows Shortcut file (.LNK) → a Windows HTA (HTML application) → an obfuscated PowerShell script.</li>
</ul>
